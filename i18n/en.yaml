# Problem Section
problem_section_title: "The Problem"
problem_title: "AI-assisted development changes everything,<br>except our methodologies."
problem_card1_title: "Silent Drift"
problem_card1_text: "AI produces code that <em>seems</em> correct but subtly deviates from your intention. Without knowing it, you accumulate invisible technical debt."
problem_card2_title: "False Alignment"
problem_card2_text: "The agent says \"done\" but left TODOs, partial implementations, ignored edge cases. The code passes tests but doesn't solve the problem."
problem_card3_title: "Context Loss"
problem_card3_text: "Each session starts from scratch. Architectural decisions get lost. Conventions erode. The project becomes an incoherent patchwork."
problem_card4_title: "Biased Validation"
problem_card4_text: "The agent that generates the code is the same one that documents it. It's the fox guarding the henhouse. Self-evaluation masks problems."

# Principles Section
principles_section_title: "The Fundamentals"
principles_title: "6 Principles for Zero Drift"
principles_p1_title: "Intention is a first-class artifact"
principles_p1_text: "Intention is not a forgotten conversation. It's a versioned, structured document that answers \"why\" and \"what\" before any \"how\"."
principles_p1_change: "→ Before generating code, intention must be formalized and validated."
principles_p2_title: "The contract is executable"
principles_p2_text: "A specification that can't be automatically verified isn't a contract, it's a wish. Every requirement has automatable validation criteria."
principles_p2_change: "→ Tests, assertions, schemas: the contract verifies itself."
principles_p3_title: "No agent validates its own work"
principles_p3_text: "An agent that generates code cannot be the source of truth on that code's quality. Validation must always come from an agent that didn't participate in production."
principles_p3_change: "→ Mandatory architecture with 4 minimum roles."
principles_p4_title: "Retro-specification is the system's memory"
principles_p4_text: "What was actually implemented must be documented objectively, independently of what the development agent claims to have done."
principles_p4_change: "→ An independent Scribe agent analyzes the code and produces the truth."
principles_p5_title: "Foundations precede features"
principles_p5_text: "When marginal development cost decreases, investing in architecture becomes rational. We prioritize what de-risks what comes next."
principles_p5_change: "→ Sequencing favors solidity, not immediate impressions."
principles_p6_title: "Skills are knowledge contracts"
principles_p6_text: "AI has outdated training data. Skills inject up-to-date knowledge and define quality criteria between phases."
principles_p6_change: "→ Each transition is mediated by an explicit skill."

# Concepts Page
concepts_page_subtitle: "Core Artifacts"
concepts_page_title: "MADD Concepts"
concepts_page_intro: "Three artifacts structure every MADD cycle: the Intention Document, the Executable Contract, and the Retro-Specification."
concepts_intention_title: "The Intention Document"
concepts_intention_intro: "<strong>The entry artifact.</strong> The starting point of every MADD cycle."
concepts_intention_questions: "The Intention Document answers three fundamental questions:"
concepts_intention_q1: "<strong>Why?</strong> — The business context, the problem to solve"
concepts_intention_q2: "<strong>What?</strong> — What needs to be delivered, expected features"
concepts_intention_q3: "<strong>How to know if it's successful?</strong> — Measurable validation criteria"
concepts_intention_structure_title: "Recommended structure"
concepts_intention_practices_title: "Best practices"
concepts_intention_practice1: "One Intention Document = one coherent unit of work"
concepts_intention_practice2: "Each requirement must have at least one validation criterion"
concepts_intention_practice3: "The \"out of scope\" is as important as the scope"
concepts_intention_practice4: "The Intention Document is versioned with the code"
concepts_contract_title: "The Executable Contract"
concepts_contract_intro: "<strong>The validation artifact.</strong> What transforms a wish into a verifiable commitment."
concepts_contract_desc: "A contract is \"executable\" when it can be verified automatically. No \"looks good\" — it either passes or fails."
concepts_contract_types_title: "Contract types"
concepts_contract_type1: "Unit tests"
concepts_contract_type1_desc: "Verify the behavior of isolated functions"
concepts_contract_type2: "Integration tests"
concepts_contract_type2_desc: "Verify interactions between components"
concepts_contract_type3: "E2E tests"
concepts_contract_type3_desc: "Verify complete user journeys"
concepts_contract_type4: "Schemas"
concepts_contract_type4_desc: "Verify data structure (JSON Schema, TypeScript)"
concepts_contract_type5: "Runtime assertions"
concepts_contract_type5_desc: "Verify invariants in production"
concepts_contract_principle_title: "The principle"
concepts_contract_principle: "<em>If you can't write a test to verify a requirement, that requirement is poorly defined.</em>"
concepts_contract_flow: "The executable contract is produced by the Spec Agent along with the Intention Document. The Dev Agent implements to satisfy the contract. The Audit Agent verifies contract compliance."
concepts_retrospec_title: "The Retro-Specification"
concepts_retrospec_intro: "<strong>The memory artifact.</strong> What objectively documents what actually exists."
concepts_retrospec_desc: "The retro-spec is not what the developer says they did. It's what an independent agent (the Scribe) observes by analyzing the code."
concepts_retrospec_diff_title: "Why it's different"
concepts_retrospec_classic: "Traditional documentation"
concepts_retrospec_madd: "MADD Retro-Specification"
concepts_retrospec_diff1_classic: "Written by the developer"

concepts_retrospec_diff4_classic: "Optimistic"
concepts_retrospec_diff4_madd: "Objective"
concepts_retrospec_content_title: "Retro-spec contents"
concepts_retrospec_content1: "<strong>Current state</strong>: What exists in the code"
concepts_retrospec_content2: "<strong>Gaps</strong>: Differences between intention and implementation"
concepts_retrospec_content3: "<strong>Technical debt</strong>: TODO, FIXME, identified workarounds"
concepts_retrospec_content4: "<strong>Dependencies</strong>: Libraries, versions, constraints"
concepts_retrospec_content5: "<strong>Attention points</strong>: Risks, known limitations"
concepts_retrospec_usage_title: "Usage"
concepts_retrospec_usage: "The retro-spec becomes the starting point for the next cycle. When new development begins, the Spec Agent consults the retro-spec to understand the real system state — not the marketing documentation."
concepts_cycle_title: "The MADD Cycle"
concepts_cycle_intro: "The three artifacts form a virtuous cycle:"
concepts_cycle_intention: "Intention"
concepts_cycle_contract: "Contract"
concepts_cycle_code: "Code"
concepts_cycle_retrospec: "Retro-Spec"
concepts_cycle_agent_spec: "Spec Agent"
concepts_cycle_agent_dev: "Dev Agent"
concepts_cycle_agent_scribe: "Scribe Agent"
concepts_cycle_step1: "<strong>Intention → Contract</strong>: The Spec Agent formalizes the need and defines success criteria"
concepts_cycle_step2: "<strong>Contract → Code</strong>: The Dev Agent implements to satisfy the contract"
concepts_cycle_step3: "<strong>Code → Audit</strong>: The Audit Agent verifies alignment"
concepts_cycle_step4: "<strong>Code → Retro-Spec</strong>: The Scribe Agent documents reality"
concepts_cycle_step5: "<strong>Retro-Spec → Intention</strong>: The next cycle starts from documented reality"

manifesto_context_intro: "<strong>AI-assisted development changes everything, except our methodologies.</strong>"
manifesto_context_p1: "Scrum, Kanban, SAFe were designed to manage the scarcity of development time. When a team of 10 people took a year to deliver a platform, planning, prioritizing, and coordinating were necessary."
manifesto_context_p2: "Today, a developer with the right AI tools delivers in 2 days what used to take 12 months."
manifesto_context_bottleneck: "<strong>Development time is no longer the bottleneck.</strong>"
manifesto_context_new_bottlenecks: "The new bottlenecks are:"

manifesto_principles_title: "The 6 MADD Principles"
manifesto_p1_title: "1. Intention is a first-class artifact"
manifesto_p1_text: "Intention is not a forgotten conversation. It's a versioned, structured document that answers \"why\" and \"what\" before any \"how\"."
