# Problem Section
problem_section_title: "The Problem"
problem_title: "AI-assisted development changes everything,<br>except our methodologies."
problem_card1_title: "Silent Drift"
problem_card1_text: "AI produces code that <em>seems</em> correct but subtly deviates from your intention. Without knowing it, you accumulate invisible technical debt."
problem_card2_title: "False Alignment"
problem_card2_text: "The agent says \"done\" but left TODOs, partial implementations, ignored edge cases. The code passes tests but doesn't solve the problem."
problem_card3_title: "Context Loss"
problem_card3_text: "Each session starts from scratch. Architectural decisions get lost. Conventions erode. The project becomes an incoherent patchwork."
problem_card4_title: "Biased Validation"
problem_card4_text: "The agent that generates the code is the same one that documents it. It's the fox guarding the henhouse. Self-evaluation masks problems."

# Principles Section
principles_section_title: "The Fundamentals"
principles_title: "6 Principles for Zero Drift"
principles_p1_title: "Intention is a first-class artifact"
principles_p1_text: "Intention is not a forgotten conversation. It's a versioned, structured document that answers \"why\" and \"what\" before any \"how\"."
principles_p1_change: "→ Before generating code, intention must be formalized and validated."
principles_p2_title: "The contract is executable"
principles_p2_text: "A specification that can't be automatically verified isn't a contract, it's a wish. Every requirement has automatable validation criteria."
principles_p2_change: "→ Tests, assertions, schemas: the contract verifies itself."
principles_p3_title: "No agent validates its own work"
principles_p3_text: "An agent that generates code cannot be the source of truth on that code's quality. Validation must always come from an agent that didn't participate in production."
principles_p3_change: "→ Mandatory architecture with 6 roles."
principles_p4_title: "Retro-specification is the system's memory"
principles_p4_text: "What was actually implemented must be documented objectively, independently of what the development agent claims to have done."
principles_p4_change: "→ An independent Witness agent analyzes the code and produces the truth."
principles_p5_title: "Foundations precede features"
principles_p5_text: "When marginal development cost decreases, investing in architecture becomes rational. We prioritize what de-risks what comes next."
principles_p5_change: "→ Sequencing favors solidity, not immediate impressions."
principles_p6_title: "Skills are knowledge contracts"
principles_p6_text: "AI has outdated training data. Skills inject up-to-date knowledge and define quality criteria between phases."
principles_p6_change: "→ Each transition is mediated by an explicit skill."

# Concepts Page
concepts_page_subtitle: "How It Works"
concepts_page_title: "MADD Concepts"
concepts_page_intro: "The MADD methodology operates through five core artifacts and a structured workflow. This page explains how they work together to eliminate drift between intention and implementation."
# Workflow
concepts_workflow_title: "The MADD Workflow"
concepts_workflow_intro: "Every MADD cycle follows a three-phase pipeline. Artifacts flow between agents — each agent reads from the previous phase's output and writes for the next."
concepts_workflow_phase1_title: "Phase 1 — Formalization"
concepts_workflow_phase1_agents: "Conductor + Architect"
concepts_workflow_phase1_desc: "The Conductor receives the need and orchestrates the cycle. The Architect formalizes the intention, annotates tasks with domains, and produces the Executable Contract with validation criteria."
concepts_workflow_phase2_title: "Phase 2 — Execution"
concepts_workflow_phase2_agents: "Maker + CI + Breaker (per fraction)"
concepts_workflow_phase2_desc: "Work is decomposed into fractions. For each fraction, a domain-specialized Maker implements, CI validates the build, and a domain-specialized Breaker audits. If the Breaker rejects, the Maker iterates."
concepts_workflow_phase3_title: "Phase 3 — Memory"
concepts_workflow_phase3_agents: "Witness"
concepts_workflow_phase3_desc: "The Witness analyzes the produced code independently — without reading what the Maker claims to have done. The resulting retro-specification documents reality and becomes the starting point for the next cycle."
concepts_workflow_principle: "Each phase's output is the next phase's input. No agent validates its own work. The cycle is anchored in reality, not in promises."
# Intention Document
concepts_intention_title: "The Intention Document"
concepts_intention_intro: "<strong>The entry artifact.</strong> Every MADD cycle begins with a formalized intention — not a chat message, not a vague request."
concepts_intention_desc: "The Intention Document captures <em>why</em> and <em>what</em> — never <em>how</em>. It is produced by the Architect Agent and serves as the foundation for the Executable Contract."
concepts_intention_fields_title: "Structure"
concepts_intention_field1: "Context"
concepts_intention_field1_desc: "The business problem. Why this work needs to happen now."
concepts_intention_field2: "Objective"
concepts_intention_field2_desc: "What the user will be able to do once delivery is complete."
concepts_intention_field3: "Requirements"
concepts_intention_field3_desc: "Numbered, testable requirements. Each one maps to a validation criterion."
concepts_intention_field4: "Validation Criteria"
concepts_intention_field4_desc: "How to verify each requirement is implemented. Automatable, not subjective."
concepts_intention_field5: "Out of Scope"
concepts_intention_field5_desc: "What is explicitly excluded. Prevents scope creep from agents."
concepts_intention_field6: "Dependencies"
concepts_intention_field6_desc: "Prerequisites that must exist before work begins."
concepts_intention_practices_title: "Best practices"
concepts_intention_practice1: "One Intention Document = one coherent unit of work"
concepts_intention_practice2: "Every requirement must map to at least one validation criterion"
concepts_intention_practice3: "The \"out of scope\" is as important as the scope — it prevents agent drift"
concepts_intention_practice4: "Version the Intention Document with the code — it's a first-class artifact, not a disposable prompt"
# Executable Contract
concepts_contract_title: "The Executable Contract"
concepts_contract_intro: "<strong>The validation artifact.</strong> What transforms a wish into a verifiable commitment."
concepts_contract_desc: "A contract is \"executable\" when it can be verified automatically. No \"looks good to me\" — it either passes or fails."
concepts_contract_hub: "The contract sits at the center of the MADD architecture. The Architect writes it alongside the Intention Document. The Maker implements to satisfy it. The CI runs it. The Breaker verifies compliance beyond automated checks. The Witness compares reality against it."
concepts_contract_types_title: "Contract types"
concepts_contract_type1: "Unit tests"
concepts_contract_type1_desc: "Verify the behavior of isolated functions"
concepts_contract_type2: "Integration tests"
concepts_contract_type2_desc: "Verify interactions between components"
concepts_contract_type3: "E2E tests"
concepts_contract_type3_desc: "Verify complete user journeys"
concepts_contract_type4: "Schemas"
concepts_contract_type4_desc: "Verify data structure (JSON Schema, TypeScript, Zod)"
concepts_contract_type5: "Runtime assertions"
concepts_contract_type5_desc: "Verify invariants in production"
concepts_contract_principle_title: "The principle"
concepts_contract_principle: "<em>If you can't write a test to verify a requirement, that requirement is poorly defined.</em>"
# Fractions
concepts_fractions_title: "Fractions"
concepts_fractions_intro: "<strong>The execution unit.</strong> Work is decomposed into small, independently deliverable fractions that each complete their own Maker → CI → Breaker cycle."
concepts_fractions_desc: "Instead of one monolithic \"implement everything, audit everything\" cycle, the Conductor decomposes tasks into fractions — small groups of 2-6 related tasks. Each fraction goes through its own cycle before the next one starts."
concepts_fractions_rules_title: "Decomposition rules"
concepts_fractions_rule1: "<strong>Size</strong> — 2-6 tasks per fraction. Small enough for focused context, large enough for coherent delivery."
concepts_fractions_rule2: "<strong>Coherence</strong> — Tasks in a fraction should be related. A database schema change and its API endpoints belong together."
concepts_fractions_rule3: "<strong>Order</strong> — Foundations first. Infrastructure and database fractions before API fractions. API before frontend."
concepts_fractions_rule4: "<strong>Independence</strong> — Each fraction produces working, tested code. The system should be functional after every fraction."
concepts_fractions_why_title: "Why fractions?"
concepts_fractions_why1: "<strong>Context control</strong> — Agents process 2-6 tasks per session instead of 20+, reducing hallucination and drift"
concepts_fractions_why2: "<strong>Focused audit</strong> — The Breaker reviews 3-4 related changes, not the entire codebase at once"
concepts_fractions_why3: "<strong>Crash recovery</strong> — If a session fails, resume from the last completed fraction, not from scratch"
concepts_fractions_why4: "<strong>Incremental delivery</strong> — Working code after each fraction, not a big-bang delivery at the end"
# Retro-Specification
concepts_retrospec_title: "The Retro-Specification"
concepts_retrospec_intro: "<strong>The memory artifact.</strong> What objectively documents what actually exists in the code."
concepts_retrospec_desc: "The retro-spec is not what the Maker says it did. It's what the Witness — an independent agent that didn't participate in development — observes by analyzing the actual code."
concepts_retrospec_diff_title: "Why it's different"
concepts_retrospec_classic: "Traditional documentation"
concepts_retrospec_madd: "MADD Retro-Specification"
concepts_retrospec_diff1_classic: "Written by the developer"
concepts_retrospec_diff1_madd: "Generated by an independent agent"

concepts_retrospec_diff3_classic: "Often outdated"
concepts_retrospec_diff3_madd: "Regenerated each cycle"
concepts_retrospec_diff4_classic: "Optimistic"
concepts_retrospec_diff4_madd: "Objective"
concepts_retrospec_content_title: "Contents"
concepts_retrospec_content1: "<strong>Current state</strong> — What exists in the code right now"
concepts_retrospec_content2: "<strong>Gaps</strong> — Differences between intention and implementation"
concepts_retrospec_content3: "<strong>Technical debt</strong> — TODO, FIXME, workarounds, identified shortcuts"
concepts_retrospec_content4: "<strong>Dependencies</strong> — Libraries, versions, constraints"
concepts_retrospec_content5: "<strong>Attention points</strong> — Risks, known limitations, areas needing future work"
concepts_retrospec_anchor_title: "The cycle anchor"
concepts_retrospec_anchor: "The retro-spec becomes the starting point for the next cycle. When a new Intention Document is drafted, the Architect consults the retro-spec to understand the real system state — not the marketing documentation, not the developer's optimistic description, but what actually exists. <strong>This is how MADD achieves zero drift:</strong> each cycle is anchored in the previous one's reality."
# Operations
concepts_operations_title: "Operations"
concepts_operations_intro: "<strong>The execution artifact.</strong> How the system runs beyond development."
concepts_operations_desc: "MADD doesn't stop at code delivery. The operations specification captures everything needed to deploy, run, and monitor the system in production."
concepts_operations_scope_title: "What operations cover"
concepts_operations_scope1: "Environments"
concepts_operations_scope1_desc: "Development, staging, production — URLs, configurations, access controls"
concepts_operations_scope2: "Infrastructure"
concepts_operations_scope2_desc: "Provider, compute, database, storage — what the system runs on"
concepts_operations_scope3: "Deployment"
concepts_operations_scope3_desc: "Strategy (rolling, blue-green), pipeline stages, rollback procedures"
concepts_operations_scope4: "Monitoring"
concepts_operations_scope4_desc: "Logging, metrics, alerting, SLOs — how you know the system is healthy"
concepts_operations_why_title: "Why operations matter in MADD"
concepts_operations_why: "When AI accelerates development, the gap between \"works locally\" and \"runs reliably in production\" becomes the new risk. <strong>Specifying operations upfront</strong> — as part of the contract, not as an afterthought — ensures the Architect thinks about deployment constraints and the Maker builds with production in mind."

skills_transition_correction_title: "Correction Skill"
skills_transition_correction_agents: "Maker Agent"
skills_transition_correction_flow: "Audit Report → Corrected Code"
skills_transition_correction_desc: "Frames how the Maker addresses audit findings. Requires root cause analysis (not just symptom fixing), mandatory regression tests for each correction, and traceability from finding to commit."

# Writing Your Own Skills
skills_custom_title: "Writing Your Own Skills"
skills_custom_intro: "The provided skills are templates. Your real skills come from your project's friction points:"
skills_custom_step1: "<strong>Identify friction</strong> — Where does the agent regularly make mistakes? What do you keep correcting?"
skills_custom_step2: "<strong>Document the gap</strong> — What knowledge is the agent missing? Write it as facts, not prose."
skills_custom_step3: "<strong>Structure as rules</strong> — Convert knowledge into imperative directives. \"MUST use\", \"NEVER do\", \"ALWAYS verify\"."
skills_custom_step4: "<strong>Test and iterate</strong> — Run a cycle with the skill. If the agent still makes mistakes, the skill is incomplete. Refine."
# Skill Lifecycle
skills_lifecycle_title: "Skill Lifecycle"
skills_lifecycle_intro: "Skills are living artifacts — they evolve with your project."
skills_lifecycle_versioning: "Version your skills with your code. They belong in the repository, not in a wiki or a shared drive. When the tech stack changes, the skills change. When conventions evolve, the skills evolve."
skills_lifecycle_structure_title: "Directory structure"
skills_lifecycle_boilerplate: "The <a href=\"https://github.com/madd-sh\" target=\"_blank\">MADD Boilerplates</a> implement this structure with ready-to-use skill templates for each domain and transition."
