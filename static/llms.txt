# MADD — Multi-Agent Driven Development

> MADD is an open-source methodology for AI-assisted development that provides the framework to control drift and drive convergence between intention and implementation. When AI codes faster than you specify, your methodology must evolve.

## Core Principles

MADD is built on 6 fundamental principles:

1. **Intention is a first-class artifact** - Intention is not a forgotten conversation. It's a versioned, structured document that answers "why" and "what" before any "how".

2. **The contract is executable** - A specification that cannot be automatically verified is not a contract, it's a wish. Every requirement has automatable validation criteria.

3. **No agent validates its own work** - An agent that generates code cannot be the source of truth on the quality of that code. Validation must always come from an agent that did not participate in production.

4. **Retro-specification is the system's memory** - What was actually implemented must be documented objectively, independently of what the development agent claims to have done.

5. **Foundations precede features** - When the marginal cost of development decreases, investing in architecture becomes rational. We prioritize what de-risks the rest.

6. **Skills are knowledge contracts** - AI has outdated training data. Skills inject up-to-date knowledge and define quality criteria between phases.

## The 6-Agent Architecture

MADD uses a mandatory architecture of 6 agents with zero conflict of interest:

- **Conductor**: Orchestrates the workflow — manages fraction-based iteration cycles, detects technical domains from task annotations, dispatches domain-specialized Maker/Breaker pairs
- **Architect Agent** (Intention Architect): Formalizes the "why" and "what", produces the Intention Document, defines validation criteria, annotates tasks with domains
- **Maker Agent** (Implementer): Domain-specialized implementation guided by skills. Transforms intention into code, respects the contract
- **CI Agent** (Quality Gate): Automated build, lint, type-check, and test validation between Maker and Breaker. If CI fails, Maker is sent back immediately
- **Breaker Agent** (Challenger): Domain-specialized verification. Challenges without complacency, identifies drifts and risks. Read-only — cannot modify code
- **Witness Agent** (Observer): Documents objective reality. Analyzes what actually exists, compares specs vs reality, produces the retro-specification

## Domain Specialization (v2)

The Maker and Breaker are template agents specialized by domain skills. The Conductor detects domains from task annotations and invokes one Maker/Breaker pair per domain:

| Domain | Maker produces | Breaker audits |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Database | Normalization, RLS, audit logging, indexing | Missing normalization, RLS, indexes, cascade risks |
| API | REST patterns, validation, rate limiting, pagination | Missing validation, auth, CORS, N+1 queries |
| Frontend | Component architecture, state management, accessibility | Performance, bundle size, accessibility, XSS |
| Security | OIDC/JWKS, RBAC, encryption, mTLS, headers | OWASP Top 10, privilege escalation, secrets |
| Infrastructure | Docker multi-stage, Compose, Terraform, secrets | Running as root, healthchecks, hardcoded secrets |

## Fraction-Based Workflow

Work is decomposed into fractions — small groups of 2-6 related tasks. Each fraction goes through its own Maker → CI → Breaker cycle. Benefits: context control, focused audit, crash recovery, incremental delivery.

## Key Concepts

### Intention Document
A structured, versioned document that formalizes the "why" and "what" before any "how". It serves as the contract between human intention and AI execution.

### Retro-Specification
Objective documentation of what was actually implemented, produced by an independent Witness agent. This becomes the project's memory and the starting point for any new iteration.

### Skills
Explicit knowledge contracts that inject up-to-date knowledge into AI agents and define quality criteria between phases. Skills operate at two levels: methodological (how the agent works) and domain (what the agent needs to know — organized as public, project, or delta files). Domain skills specialize Maker/Breaker agents per technical domain.

### Fractions
Small, independently deliverable units of work (2-6 tasks). Each fraction completes its own Maker → CI → Breaker cycle before the next one starts. Enables context control, focused audit, crash recovery, and incremental delivery.

### Operations
The specification of how the system runs beyond development: environments, infrastructure, deployment strategy, and monitoring.

### Drift Control
The core framework of MADD: providing the mechanisms to control drift and drive convergence between what you intended and what was actually implemented, through mandatory separation of concerns and independent validation.

## Migration from Legacy Methodologies

MADD provides a path from Scrum/Kanban/SAFe:
- Sprints → Intention Cycles (no fixed duration)
- Stories → Intention Docs + Executable Contracts
- Estimation → Obsolete (development is too fast)
- Code Review → Independent Agent Audit (domain-specialized Breaker)
- Definition of Done → Formal Audit Skill
- Retrospectives → Consolidations (improve skills, not process)
